        <b>Project 1:</b><br>
        Title - Azure Cloud Application - Consultants for Hire.<br>
        Developed an application on the Azure cloud utilizing Azure SQL Database and a Node.js/Express.js
        server.<br>
        Implemented API endpoints (/most_experience and /lowest_rate) to retrieve consultant data based on skill
        parameters.<br>
        Configured secure networking between the data server and the Azure SQL Database.<br>
        Technologies Used: Azure Cloud, Azure SQL Database, Node.js, Express.js.<br>
        Project Duration: 3 weeks.<br>
    </p>

        <b>Project 2:</b><br>
        Title - Predictive Modeling - Data Classification.<br>
        Implemented predictive models for data classification.<br>
        Cleaned and prepared the "adult-dataset.csv" file from the census bureau database.<br>
        Performed dimensionality reduction using SVD and PCA methods.<br>
        Trained multi-layer Perceptron, Logistic Regression, and Na√Øve Bayes models.<br>
        Evaluated models using confusion matrices and classification reports.<br>
        Applied K-Means clustering for income prediction.<br>
        Technologies Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-Learn.<br>
        Project Duration: 3 weeks.<br>

        <b>Project 3:</b><br>
        Title - Emotion Detection in Faces.<br>
        Developed a deep neural network model to detect emotions in faces using a dataset of grayscale images.<br>
        Achieved a validation accuracy of at least 60% through experimentation with hyperparameters.<br>
        Evaluated the model's performance using the test dataset, generating the Confusion Matrix and Classification
        Report.<br>
        Utilized TensorBoard and grid search to explore multiple model variations and determine the most accurate
        configuration.<br>
        Technologies Used: Python, Deep Learning, CNN, TensorBoard.<br>
